# battleship_game
Simple interactive battleship game with GUI built using pygame

This version uses the pygame library to create a graphical user interface for the game. The game board is displayed as a grid of cells, and the player can click on a cell to make a guess. The game board and results are drawn on the pygame window, allowing for a more interactive gameplay experience.

Please make sure you have the pygame library installed (run "pip install pygame" in terminal) before running the code.
